### Hi, I'm Daniel!

[<img src="https://curl.se/logo/curl-logo.svg" width=300 align=right>](https://curl.se/)

I am and have been an avid open source supporter and developer since the mid 1990s. My code is almost guaranteed
to run in your devices, in one way or another.

I founded and lead the development of the [curl project](https://github.com/curl/curl) and I do spurious
contributions in other network related projects like [libssh2](https://github.com/libssh2/libssh2) and
[c-ares](https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares).

I have authored the following books: [Uncurled](https://un.curl.dev/), [everything curl](https://everything.curl.dev), [HTTP/3 explained](https://http3-explained.haxx.se) and [http2 explained](https://http2-explained.haxx.se).

File issues and pull-requests in any and all of the projects I participate in. Contact me via
email at `daniel@haxx.se` on twitter at [@bagder](https://twitter.com/bagder/) or on IRC in the
`#curl` channel on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/).

Everything about me and my projects are also available on [my website](https://daniel.haxx.se).
